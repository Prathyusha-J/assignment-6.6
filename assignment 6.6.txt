				ASSIGNMENT 6.3

1. Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler
A)
	FIFO SCHEDULER					CAPACITY SCHEDULER
      (i)It is a default scheduler that does'nt involve in                 (i)This includes preemption but this stops when the 
         Preemption					job fails.
      (ii)It does'nt  have fair sharing of resources.	             (ii) This always includes fair sharing of the resources.
      (iii)It involves in better work with the small clusters.             (iii)It involves in work with the large clusters.
      (iv)only after completion of previous job,next jobs	             (iv) Here multiple job queues can be allocated.
          will be assigned.

2. What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x
A) (i)Hadoop 1.x tends  to support only one namespace for the management of hdfs.
        Hadoop 2.x results in supporting multiple namespaces.
     (ii)Hadoop 1.x supports majorly mapreduce.
         Hadoop 2.x supports YARN which also includes mapreduce and so on.
     (iii)Hadoop 1.x lacks scalability and other features
          Hadoop 2.x overcomes them by its new architecture.
     (iv)Hadoop 1.x contain about 4000 nodes per cluster.
          Hadoop 2.x has double the time nodes per cluster.
     (v)Hadoop 1.x contains fixed-sized storage slots.
         Hadoop 2.x have variable-sized storage slots in it for large storage.
